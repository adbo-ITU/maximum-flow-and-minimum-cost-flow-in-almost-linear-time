# The Feasibility of Implementing Maximum Flow and Minimum-Cost Flow in Almost-Linear Time with an IPM

This repository contains source code and work for our research project, in which we evaluate the feasibility of using the algorithm by [Chen, Kyng, Liu, Peng, Gutenberg, and Sachdeva (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00671) in practice. Their algorithm provides the first known (theoretical) algorithm for finding maximum flow and minimum-cost flow in almost-linear time.

We provide the first, as far as we know, partial implementation and experimental evaluation of the algorithm, alongside a more accessible and higher-level overview of their paper.
